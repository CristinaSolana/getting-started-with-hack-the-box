# Getting Started with HackTheBox

Slides and resources for the [CyberAegis](https://twitter.com/cyber4egis) hands-on workshop introducing core penetration testing concepts to get started with Hack The Box by presenting a step-by-step walkthrough of the HTB Nibbles box.

Nibbles is an easy Linux box that suffers from a known vulnerability that allows you to exploit file upload that leads to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) and gives you the ability to escalate your privileges with a script that can be run as root with no password.
